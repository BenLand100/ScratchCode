This repository is basically a collection of stuff I wrote that I never finished
(which is most of what I write), or, more accurately, never made a releasable 
version/demonstration/gui for the code. There are lots of cool things in here 
and many helpful bits of code. All the Project Euler solutions I make will go 
here, along with IRC bots I work on. There is a lisp ircd, pascal maze solving
algorithms, a pascal OCR library, java 2D perspective transformations, some
edge detection, physics simulations, and other random stuff.

Enjoy!
